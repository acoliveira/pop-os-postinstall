Running Windows Apps on Lubuntu 20.04 with Wine
Oct 20, 2019

Installing Wine
Let’s start applying a i386 architecture in our x64 system.

sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386
sudo nala update
Now let’s installing the necessaries packages of wine.

sudo nala install --install-recommends wine64
sudo nala install --install-recommends winetricks
sudo nala install --install-recommends wine-binfmt
sudo nala install --install-recommends winbind
sudo nala install --install-recommends mono-complete
sudo nala install fonts-wine
Now we will to create a Wine Prefix.

wineboot -u
# Alternative: wine start hostname
We need to download some MSI packages of Mono and Gecko to improve wine.

Let’s install the packages on wine.

# Mono
wget https://dl.winehq.org/wine/wine-mono/5.1.0/wine-mono-5.1.0-x86.msi
wine msiexec /i ./wine-mono-5.1.0-x86.msi

# Gecko 32 bits
wget http://dl.winehq.org/wine/wine-gecko/2.47.1/wine-gecko-2.47.1-x86.msi
wine msiexec /i ./wine-gecko-2.47.1-x86.msi

# Gecko 64 bits (need 32)
wget http://dl.winehq.org/wine/wine-gecko/2.47.1/wine-gecko-2.47.1-x86_64.msi
wine msiexec /i ./wine-gecko-2.47.1-x86_64.msi
Some tricks
We can start a windows app, access the wine settings and control panel with those commands bellow.

# Change Windows version, set libraries and drive
winecfg

# Control Panel
wine start control

# To run some app in Prefix path
wine start notepad.exe

# To run some app out of Prefix path
wine start /unix /usr/share/sample/app.exe
We may need install some extra packages like .NET and Visual C++.

# .NET 3.5
winetricks dotnet35

# .NET 4.6
winetricks dotnet46

# Visual C++ libraris 2012
winetricks vcrun2012

# Extra fonts
winetricks tahoma corefonts ie8

...
Another utils commands are:

wine --version
winetricks list
winetricks list-all
winetricks apps list
